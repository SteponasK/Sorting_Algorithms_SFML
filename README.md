# Sorting Algorithm visualisation
![menu_picture](ReadMe_img/menu.png)

Sorting algorithms visualisation made using SFML and C++, used to learn how a sorting algorithm works.
## Available algorithms
1. Bubble sort
1. Shaker (Coctail) Sort
1. Selection Sort
1. Double selection sort
1. Insertion Sort

## Features
 ![Sorting_Algorithm_Gif](ReadMe_img/sorting_algorithm.gif)
- 5 Different Sorting Algorithms
- Change number of Bars to be sorted
- Change FrameRate (FPS) cap
- Explanation, of how each sorting algorithm works.

## Prerequisites
You need to have [CMake]((https://cmake.org/download/)) or [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) installed.


## Installation    

#### If you have CMake installed:

Open your Command Prompt or Terminal

For a single-configuration generator (typically the case on Linux and macOS):

-
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```

For a multi-configuration generator (typically the case on Windows):

-    
   ```    
    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```


#### Compiling it yourself with SFML:
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SteponasK/Sorting_Algorithms_SFML
```
1. Configure your project, using online [guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php) or a youtube [ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neIoDQ71yb0).

1. Compile all the files using Visual Studio or the IDE of your choice.
## Built With

* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Software Development Library 
* [C++](https://cplusplus.com/)  Programming Language

## Contributing

Currently, contributing to the project is not available, as the project was created for me to learn SFML, C++ and Sorting Algorithm theory.
Howerer feel free to fork this project, and experiment with your own modifications!
